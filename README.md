## Arcane Tracker 

An automatic Hearthstone tracker for Android. See https://arcanetracker.com/ for the details.


## Contributing

There are several ways to contribute:

1. Pull request are generally welcome. 
 * In general, it's best to reach out before starting to work on anything too complicated. For an example, open an issue with the proposed fix improvment so a discussion can happen before the actual fix. 
 * Short pull requests are prefered.
2. Translations are very appreciated. 
 * I can usually do french/english but better russian/korean/portuguese/spanish translations would be awesome. 
 * If you know git, feel free to make a pull request directly. Else you can send me a translated xml file (e.g. https://github.com/HearthSim/arcane_tracker/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values-es/strings.xml).
3. Feedback and bug reports:
 * Feel free to open issues for these.
 * For bug reports, please try to be as descriptive as possible. In particular, there's a button inside the app that'll send the logs so it's easier to investigate.
4. Donations are very welcome. They allow me to spend more time working on arcane tracker.
